\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Irregular codes have data-dependent access patterns.
Therefore, compilers need to make pessimistic assumptions leading to very conservative code.
While DSLs for irregular codes allow us the flexibility to make more informed decisions about the domain, existing DSLs lack adaptability.
Different graphs expect different kinds of processing to achieve the best performance.
While existing DSLs do allow changing the algorithm specification to be changed to suit a purpose, it would be ideal if the specification remains intact and the compiler judiciously generates the necessary efficient code.
We presented our experiences in achieving the same, for a graph DSL, Falcon.
In particular, we auto-generated codes for vertex-based and edge-based processing, for synchronous versus asynchronous processing, and for CPU versus GPU versus multi-GPU processing.
We illustrated the effectiveness of our techniques using a variety of algorithms and several real-world graphs.
We believe other DSLs would also benefit from our proposal.
